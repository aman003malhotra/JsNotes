// Quite soon we’re going to learn functions (a way to group commands), so let’s note in advance that "use strict" can be put at the beginning of a function.
// Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually people use it for the whole script

// Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.

// There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior.
// Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back.

// "use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.
