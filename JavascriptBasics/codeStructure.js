// Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
// We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

// A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. Here, JavaScript interprets 
// the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

// JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]

// it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.

// COMMENTS
// Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */

// There may not be /*...*/ inside another /*...*/.

// Such code will die with an error

// There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. 
// They remove comments, so they don’t appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.
