class User {
    constructor(name) { this.name = name; }

  // proof: User is a function
  alert(typeof User); // function


// What class User {...} construct really does is:

// 1. Creates a function named User, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the constructor method (assumed empty if we donâ€™t write such method).
// 2. Stores class methods, such as sayHi, in User.prototype
