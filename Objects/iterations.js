// unlike arrays you can't simply iterate an object

// for in loop
// Object.keys()
// Object.values()
// Object.entries()

// in ES5 the order is not fixed


// for in Loops also gives properties of parents 
// Object.keys() // don't climb to parent 

// Reflect.ownKeys(obj) also gives enumerable keys but object.keys does not give it
